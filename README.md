# TaskMaster - Task Management App

## About Me

Hello, I'm **Zibran Khan**, an iOS developer passionate about building seamless user experiences with **SwiftUI**, **Swift**, and **Xcode**. TaskMaster is my very first iOS app project that I've developed to learn and apply modern iOS development techniques.

I‚Äôve leveraged **SwiftUI** to create a smooth, interactive task management app with a focus on usability, customization, and persistence using **UserDefaults**.

## Project Overview üöÄ

**TaskMaster** is a task management app that allows users to easily create, manage, and track their tasks. The app offers a streamlined intro experience, task creation, task completion tracking, and local persistence. The entire app is built using **SwiftUI** to ensure a native, modern iOS look and feel.

- **Task Creation**: Users can quickly add new tasks.
- **Task Management**: Tasks can be marked as completed or deleted.
- **Intro Screens**: Interactive intro screens that provide a guided user onboarding experience.
- **Persistent Data**: The tasks are saved locally across app sessions using **UserDefaults**.

## Skills & Technologies üõ†Ô∏è

Through this project, I was able to dive deeper into various iOS development concepts and technologies. Some of the key tools and practices I worked with include:

- **Swift**: The programming language used to build the core logic of the app.
- **SwiftUI**: Apple's declarative framework for creating user interfaces across all Apple platforms.
- **UserDefaults**: Used for storing tasks and ensuring data persists across app restarts.
- **MVVM Architecture**: The **Model-View-ViewModel** design pattern was used to structure the app and ensure scalability and maintainability.
- **Navigation**: Implemented `NavigationStack` and `NavigationLink` for smooth navigation between screens.
- **State Management**: Managed app state using `@State` and `@Binding` to ensure that UI updates are reactive to changes in data.

## Features üì±

- **Intro Screens**: Interactive onboarding experience with a `TabView` that guides users through the features of TaskMaster.
- **Task Management**: Add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks with a swipe.
- **Task Persistence**: Tasks are saved and loaded using **UserDefaults** to ensure data is retained even after app restarts.
- **Task Editing**: Edit task details and save updates dynamically.
- **Task Deletion**: Swipe-to-delete feature with confirmation for a more streamlined user experience.
