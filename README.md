TaskMaster - Task Management App
About Me
Hello, I'm Zibran Khan, an iOS developer passionate about building seamless user experiences with SwiftUI, Swift, and Xcode. TaskMaster is my very first iOS app project that I've developed to learn and apply modern iOS development techniques.
I’ve leveraged SwiftUI to create a smooth, interactive task management app with a focus on usability, customization, and persistence using UserDefaults.

Project Overview 🚀
TaskMaster is a task management app that allows users to easily create, manage, and track their tasks. The app offers a streamlined intro experience, task creation, task completion tracking, and local persistence. The entire app is built using SwiftUI to ensure a native, modern iOS look and feel.
Task Creation: Users can quickly add new tasks.
Task Management: Tasks can be marked as completed or deleted.
Intro Screens: Interactive intro screens that provide a guided user onboarding experience.
Persistent Data: The tasks are saved locally across app sessions using UserDefaults.

Skills & Technologies 🛠️
Through this project, I was able to dive deeper into various iOS development concepts and technologies. Some of the key tools and practices I worked with include:
Swift: The programming language used to build the core logic of the app.
SwiftUI: Apple's declarative framework for creating user interfaces across all Apple platforms.
UserDefaults: Used for storing tasks and ensuring data persists across app restarts.
MVVM Architecture: The Model-View-ViewModel design pattern was used to structure the app and ensure scalability and maintainability.
Navigation: Implemented NavigationStack and NavigationLink for smooth navigation between screens.
State Management: Managed app state using @State and @Binding to ensure that UI updates are reactive to changes in data.

Features 📱
Intro Screens: Interactive onboarding experience with a TabView that guides users through the features of TaskMaster.
Task Management: Add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks with a swipe.
Task Persistence: Tasks are saved and loaded using UserDefaults to ensure data is retained even after app restarts.
Task Editing: Edit task details and save updates dynamically.
Task Deletion: Swipe-to-delete feature with confirmation for a more streamlined user experience.
